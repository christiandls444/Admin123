  They don't feel. Theyre are wayy to many people in this world that don't truly care if they hurt anothers feelings. And its like it makes them feel better about themself. But in reality  they're only insecure about something they have to deal with  whether it be personally or physically or emotionally..just because your not happy with yourself  doesn't mean you should try to make others feel worse about themselves. But that is just my opinion and what do I know. Friendliness only gets a slap in the face more often than not. :] pass it on haha,not cybercrime,1

  Hmmm.. Perhaps how if we want to take over an entire country we can make sure we do so  but when it comes to third world starving countries..well we can only send so much food.r Another would be how we control missles by satelite and split atoms to destroy anything we want but we cant stop this oil spill. Ohh no. Its out of our control.r &amp;&amp; I guess the inhumane way of growing all our food supplies is something to overlook as well. Only being that the animals literally cant think  move  do anything ut produce giagantic chicken breasts and stand in their own poop their entire life till the stock yards. Sooo its way out of our hands for that as well. r All these things need to be asked to our 'Oh SO lets make a change' president because the way I see it  theres no changes only what the government cares about is what is necessary. and that is wrong.,not cybercrime,1

  I think it's no different than a woman to hit a man than a man to hit a woman  first of all. But up foremost  I believe that If a man is willing to hit a female  whom is half the size  half the strength  half the fury  then the man is half of what a real man is. He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever.,not cybercrime,1
